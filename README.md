## Prescript Aid

Prescript Aid is a mobile application that utilizes Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning technologies to automate the process of recognizing and converting handwritten prescriptions by doctors into readable digital text. By leveraging advanced models like Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), this project aims to reduce confusion and errors for patients and pharmacists while reading prescriptions. It aims to improve patient safety by enhancing the accuracy of prescription interpretation, particularly in regions with a shortage of doctors compared to the patient population.
Features

    Prescription Image Upload: Users can upload images of handwritten prescriptions.
    AI-based Prescription Extraction: The application uses advanced AI models (OCR, CNN, RNN) to extract the text from handwritten prescriptions.
    Prescription Information: The application provides meaningful insights and information on the prescriptions, including medication details.
    Medication Reminders: The app sends notifications to remind users about their medication intake.
    Enhanced Accuracy: Improves the accuracy of interpreting prescriptions, especially where doctor handwriting may be unclear.

## Technologies Used

   # Flutter: The front-end of the application is built using Flutter, ensuring cross-platform compatibility for iOS and Android.
   # Django: The back-end is powered by Django, handling API connections and server-side logic.
   # AI and Machine Learning Models:
        OCR (Optical Character Recognition): Converts handwritten text into machine-readable text.
        CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks): Used for image processing and pattern recognition.
        RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks): Helps in sequence processing for understanding handwritten text.

## Project Goals

    Improve patient safety by ensuring accurate interpretation of handwritten prescriptions.
    Help pharmacists and patients easily read and understand prescriptions, reducing confusion.
    Provide an easy-to-use platform for users to upload prescriptions, view medication details, and receive reminders.
    Focus on performance, scalability, reliability, security, and user-friendliness to create an effective user experience.


    Doctorâ€™s Handwriting: Addresses the common issue of poor handwriting by doctors, which often leads to misinterpretation of prescriptions.
    Efficiency in Developing Countries: Helps in countries with a shortage of doctors by providing an automated solution for prescription reading and medication management.
    Patient Safety: Ensures higher accuracy in interpreting prescriptions to avoid medication errors and improve trust between doctors and patients.
